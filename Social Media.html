        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>Social media platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in enhancing the user experience and improving platform efficiency. AI algorithms are used to analyze vast amounts of data, understand user preferences, and deliver personalized content to users.</p>
        <p><strong>AI Applications in Social Media</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Content Recommendation:</strong> AI algorithms analyze user behavior and interactions to recommend relevant content, such as posts, videos, and advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> AI can gauge public sentiment by analyzing social media posts and comments, helping businesses understand customer feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Social media platforms use AI-powered chatbots to provide instant customer support and address common queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Image and Speech Recognition:</strong> AI enables social media platforms to automatically tag and identify objects, faces, and locations in images and videos.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad Targeting:</strong> AI algorithms analyze user data to deliver targeted advertisements based on user interests and behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Benefits and Concerns</strong></p>
